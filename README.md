# Hyperlegible
A World of Warcraft addon that increases accessibility for players with low vision by replacing interface fonts with Atkinson Hyperlegible.
> *Atkinson Hyperlegible is a typeface created in partnership with Braille Institute. It has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.*
>* ***Four fonts**, including two weights, in both roman and oblique*
>* ***One thousand, three hundred, and forty** total glyphs across all fonts*
>* *Accent characters supporting **twenty-seven languages***

Currently the addon just replaces all the interface's default fonts universally, and the fonts are also available internally to other addons via LibSharedMedia.

**Please be aware that this addon is a work in progress!** Any interface addons enabled on your client may cause conflicts, though they will likely just ignore Hyperlegible's changes altogether. 

### TODO:
1. Configuration panel for user customization
2. 'Font-Finder' tool to help identify which fonts correspond to which interface elements
3. Support/exceptions for popular interface overhaul addons
4. Classic/BCC support
