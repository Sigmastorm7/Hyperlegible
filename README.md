# Hyperlegible
---
A World of Warcraft addon that improves UI text legibility by replacing default fonts with **Atkinson Hyperlegible**.

This addon is for players that 
* have low vision (loss of sight that is not correctable with RX lenses),
* wear prescription glasses or contacts,
* experience fatigue or eye strain when focusing for long periods of time,
* and are generally dissatisfied with the legibility of WoW's interface text.

Currently the addon just replaces all the interface's default fonts universally, and the fonts are also available internally to other addons via LibSharedMedia.

**Please be aware that this addon is a work in progress!** Any interface addons enabled on your client may cause conflicts, though they will more than likely just ignore Hyperlegible's changes altogether. 

>Typeface features:
>* **Four fonts**, including two weights, in both roman and oblique
>* **One thousand, three hundred, and forty** total glyphs across all fonts
>* Accent characters supporting **twenty-seven languages**
>

#### TODO:
* Configuration panel for user customization
* Localization (deDE, esES/esMX, frFR, itIT, ptBR)
* 'Font-Finder' tool to help identify which fonts correspond to which interface elements
* Support/exceptions for popular interface overhaul addons
* Classic/BCC support
