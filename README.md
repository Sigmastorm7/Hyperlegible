# Hyperlegible
---
A World of Warcraft addon that increases UI text legibility for players with low vision by replacing default fonts with Atkinson Hyperlegible.
Although this is primarily an accessibility feature, any players frustrated by the legibility of WoW's interface text would see an improvement.
Currently the addon just replaces all the interface's default fonts universally, and the fonts are also available internally to other addons via LibSharedMedia.

**Please be aware that this addon is a work in progress!** Any interface addons enabled on your client may cause conflicts, though they will more than likely just ignore Hyperlegible's changes altogether. 

>Typeface features:
>* **Four fonts**, including two weights, in both roman and oblique
>* **One thousand, three hundred, and forty** total glyphs across all fonts
>* Accent characters supporting **twenty-seven languages**
>
> *More information available at [BrailleInstitute.org](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)*

#### TODO:
* Configuration panel for user customization
* Localization
* 'Font-Finder' tool to help identify which fonts correspond to which interface elements
* Support/exceptions for popular interface overhaul addons
* Classic/BCC support
